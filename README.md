## Name
Job-Aid was chosen because it is descriptive and concise.

## Description
Job-Aid is a web application that helps candidates look for a job using a job title, zip code and State.
Unlike a traditional website, Job-Aid could have an added feature of posting articles related to companies recruitment strategies to help candidates focus on companies with the same shared interests such as working for companies hiring moms, veterans or handicapped.

Job-Aid was developed using HTML, CSS, UI Kit, JavaScript and two APIs to get jobs from locations in the United States. It is still in progress as many features will be added to it such as a live stock market window.
